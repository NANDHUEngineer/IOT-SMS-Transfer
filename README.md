Prject Title:ANALYSIS ON HUMAN BRAIN 
USING GRAPHULO METHOD TO RETRIEVE PLASTICITY OF BRAIN CONNECTOME
ABSTRACT
Virtual brain research is accelerating the development of inexpensive real-time Brain IoT Systems. Hardware improvements that increase the capability of Virtual brain analyze and Brain IoT wearable sensors have made possible several new software frameworks for developers to use and create applications combining Brain and IoT. It also enables multiple sensory pathways for communications with a larger sized data to users’ brains. The intersections of these two research paths are accelerating both ﬁelds and will drive the needs for an energy-aware infrastructure to support the wider local bandwidth demands in the IoT cloud. 
In this project, we complete a survey on Brain activity Extraction in IoT from various perspectives, including Electroencephalogram (EEG) based IoT models, machine learning, and current active platforms. Based on our investigations, the main ﬁndings of this survey highlights three major development trends of virtual brain development system, which are EEG, IoT, and cloud computing.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
With advances in high throughput brain data at the cellular and sub cellular level, there is growing demands for platforms that can support high, large scale brain data processing & analysis. To address these challenges, BRAIN-IOT enable smart autonomous behavior in Internet of Things with some sensors and cloud. In addition, Brain IOT provides a set of components that guarantee the security & privacy protection of the data during

IMPLEMENTATION 
Here, firstly the EEG headset with sensor is connected to the microprocessor ARDUINO board and it is connected to the ESP8266 which is interconnected to the TFT touchscreen. Firstly, the EEG headset sensors the EEG signal from the brain with the electrodes present in the headset and it checks whether it is alive or dead.
After sensing, if the result comes it is normal, and then it will be displayed on the touch screen. If we want in software application, then we check the status of the brain in ARDUINO IDE using the cable connected to hardware kit and the device is to be installed into the system/laptop in which Arduino software has been installed.  In tools menu, present in the Arduino application, click on the port which is enabled and after that we can directly see the status of the brain in the monitor. If any modification or update is noticed then the status will be sent through SMS and email id for specific person in contact. Python is a wonderful and powerful programming language that's easy to use (easy to read and write) and, with Raspberry Pi, lets you connect your project to the real world.


conculsion
In this project, we described a cloud-based system for performing large-scale brain connectivity analysis. We demonstrated that our approach can achieve fast data query and extraction for analytics and visualization. 

	FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
There are many avenues for future work. First, we would like to enhance the web GUI by making it more interactive and user friendly. 
Further, we intend to scale up to process much larger datasets (terabytes and above) with the goal of one day being able to perform such analysis on the human brain. We are also exploring the use of a poly store database such as Big DAWG as a data. Here we are using login id for every user, through that they are accessing their data.
In future, thumb impression for every user can be added instead of login id. With this log id, misuse of data is possible. And this great kit can be converted into a chip and can insert either internally or externally. And also, every person can use this in day-to-day life and can definitely escape from accidental health issues and also from forgeries being done without the particular persons.
